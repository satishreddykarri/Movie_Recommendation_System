# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Details
The Movie Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to recommend movies to users based on different techniques such as:
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to those a user has previously liked by analyzing movie features such as genre, director, and cast.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user interactions and preferences to suggest movies based on what similar users have watched.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.

This project currently focuses on recommending **English-language movies**, using datasets that primarily contain English movie titles and metadata. Future improvements may include expanding support for multilingual movie recommendations.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps to ensure optimal recommendations.

## Features
- Content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieRecommendationSystem.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd MovieRecommendationSystem
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb
```
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and generate recommendations.

## Dependencies
